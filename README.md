# HCAD-Property-Assessor

This project is still a work in progress but to sum it up, I am not a fan of the HCAD property assessor's practices in some cases placing arbitrary and antiquated valuation techniques resulting in significant tax burdens for Houston's property owners.

So we'll use their data and the power of R to solve the issue for Houstonians everywhere. More details to follow. Stay tuned.
